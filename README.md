# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains jupyter notebooks providing an implementation of basic Machine Learning models for regression and classification.

## Notebook 1: Nearest Neighbours Classification
It contains an implementation of nearest neighbours methods for classification:
1) K-Nearest Neighbor method (k=1)
2) Conformal Predictor.
Each algorithm is implemented on two datasets: Iris dataset from scikit-learn, Dataset imported from ionosphere.txt

## Notebook 2: Regression Methods
It provides an implementation of an inductive conformal predictor for regression and the ability to use the Lasso method, data preprocessing, and tools for parameter selection in scikit-learn.

It is a basic repository to have an understanding of ways to apply the ideas and algorithms of machine learning for classification and regression.
