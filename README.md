# Nearest-Neighbour
This repository contains jupyter notebooks providing an implementation of basic Machine Learning models:

## Notebook 1: Nearest Neighbours 
It contains an implementation of nearest neighbours methods for classification:
1) K-Nearest Neighbor method (k=1)
2) Conformal Predictor.

Each algorithm is implemented on two datasets: Iris dataset from scikit-learn, Dataset imported from ionosphere.txt


It is a basic notebook to understand how to make Machine Learning models and analyse the results. Relevant details are all added in the notebook.
