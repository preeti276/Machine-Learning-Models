# Nearest-Neighbour
This repository contains jupyter notebooks providing an implementation of Nearest Neighbours methods for classification:
1) K-Nearest Neighbor method (k=1)
2) Conformal Predictor.

Each algorithm is implemented on two datasets:

1) Iris dataset from scikit-learn: In this dataset, each sample has 4 features describing sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an iris plant. There are three possible labels, Y = {0,1,2}

2) Dataset imported from ionosphere.txt: The file ionosphere.txt contains data collected by a radar system in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system consists of a co-phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. Each line of this file represents one labelled sample with comma-separated features. The last number in the line describes the classication. \Good" (+1) radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. \Bad" (-1) returns are those that do not.

It is a basic notebook to understand how to make Machine Learning models and analyse the results. Relevant details are all added in the notebook.
